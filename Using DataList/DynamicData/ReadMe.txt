Changes happened on the file Publisher.aspx
1- Create a DataSource through SqlDataSource to bind the publisher table, then
2- Bind the data through the configuration 
3- By checking the code that generated by the VS we will see 
that the sign # refers to the data binding expression for 
 binding process + the Eval function that gets the column name to get the data
 and bind it to the server property Text-->
